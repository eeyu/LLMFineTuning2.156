The multiple choice question should be labeled with the word ""Question"" and the answer to the question should be labeled with the word ""Answer."""," 4.8 Payload and Spacecraft Load Combination  
4.8.1  [LAR 41] In cases where loads produced by different environments can occur simultaneously, these loads shall  be combined statistically  to define the limit load for each time/event period  in load regime of interest . 
Common types of load combinations include static pressure loading occurring at the same time as turbulent buffeting during atmospheric entry and thermal loads occurring at th e same 
time as deployment release loads and/or end of travel loads.  
4.8.2  [LAR 42] Combinations of these loads occur at different times in flight and shall  be examined for each flight event.  
4.8.3  [LAR 43] Loads from each load regime contributor shall  be combined by adding the means and root -sum-squaring the dispersed portions.  
4.8.4  [LAR 44] The statistical distributions of each load regime contributor shall  describe the peaks of the loads.  
The dispersed portions are the differences between the me ans and the required statistical enclosure levels, typically 99.87  percent  enclosure with 50  percent  confidence level  (99.87/50) . For liftoff,  the simultaneously  occurring environments  are described  in Appendix B.2.1. 
4.8.5  [LAR 45] The quasi -static, low  frequency  transient  loads , and random  vibration/acoustic  limit loads  shall  be combined as approved by the delegated Technical Authority to determine  the total load environment  for liftoff.
For a component  that weighs  more  than 500 kilograms  (kg), the overall  random vibration load may be assumed  to be small  relative  to the low frequency  transient  load and therefore  neglected.  For components  weighing  less than 500 kg, the appropriate  method of load combination  will be  dependent  on how the low frequency  and the random vibration acoustic  design environments  of the event  are specified . 
Typically,  the maximum  levels  are defined  as requirements  for a flight event  such as liftoff,  even if these maxima  do not necessarily  occur  at the  same  time. The  relative  timing  of the transient  and random  vibration environments  is unique  for each  LV, but simultaneous  occurrence of maximum low frequency transient  and maximum random  vibration  load is improbable . Therefore,  a root-sum-square (RSS)  approach is acceptable  for combining the maximum low frequency  and maximum random  vibration loads  for the liftoff  fligh t event . Whe n the low frequenc y transient  and random  vibration environments  are specified  in a time-correlated  manner,  a time-consistent approach is also acceptable  for combining the low frequency transient  loads  and the random vibration loads.  
4.8.6  [LAR 46] Whe n an RSS approach  to defining component  loads  is utilized,  the maximum low frequency  load factor and  maximum random  vibration  load factor  shall  be root-sum-squared (RSS'd ).  The RSS'd values  are then applied in all axes simultaneously . When  the load combination is directly  applied to member loads, the maximum random  vibration  member forces and low frequency  member  forces  are RSS'd.  
4.8.7  [LAR 47] When a time-consistent /load regime -consistent  approach to defining  component  loads  is utilized,  the low frequency  transient  load factor  and random  vibration load 
factor  shall  be combined  in a time-consistent /load regime -consistent  manner .  
When  the load combination is directly  applied to member  loads, the member  loads  due to low frequency  and random  vibration are combined in a time-consistent /load regime -consistent  manner.

4.9.1.1  [LAR 49] Verification  of the payload and spacecraft dynamic model s by modal  survey  testing  shall  be performed  to ensure  the model  is sufficiently  accurate for load and  deflection predictions . 
Refer to NASA- STD-7002, Payload Test Requirements . Payload  dynamic model  verification  may be accomplished  by a combination  of payload  level  and component level  modal  survey  tests.  A payload or component with a minimum frequency higher than the model upper bound frequency requirement defined by the LV organization can substitute sinusoidal sweep vibration testing to verify the frequency. In this case, mode shape correlation is not required. Additional guidance and references for modal survey testing can be found in NASA -HDBK -7005.  
Verification of spacecraft dynamic models may require off -loading systems that simulate the free-free boundary conditions of the spacecraft.

Significant modes may be selected based on an effective mass calculation, but this set should be augmented by modes which are critical for specific load or deflection definition. All modes within the frequency range of the test should be identified and measured if at all practical.  
 
4.9.1.3  [LAR 51] If the complexity of the system is such that a subset of modes can only be measured, then the subset shall  include the first two primary bending  modes, first axial, first 
torsion, and modes of appendages included in the test article.  
Other modes should be measured such that the total number of modes provides sufficient constraints to the model correlation process so as to yield a test -verified m odel. This typically

4.9.1.6  [LAR 54] The modal  survey  test shall  include  techniques  approved by the delegated Technical Authority to  identify  nonlinearities.  
Varying input  excitation levels  and reciprocity checks  are commonly  utilized  for linearity 
assessment . Significant  nonlinearities  may require  sinusoidal  testing  at multiple  force  levels. In  the case of nonlinearities  that affect  load predictions, the frequencies  and mode  shapes should be obtained from  the highest  practical  excitation  levels . The  load model  has to then be developed  from  the available  data using  best engineering  judgment, and the effects  of the resulting model  uncertainty  on the loads  has to be incorporated. 
4.9.1.7  [LAR 55] Agreement between test and analysis natural frequencies (after model correlation) shall  be within 5 percent for the target/significant modes . 
The delegated Technical Authority can incorporate a modal effective mass (i.e. , mass participation) requirement. The total modal effective mass for a direction is simply the sum of all contributions of all modes in that direction. For typical payload/ space craft, these totals are often above 80 percent . For smaller, stiffer payload/ spacecraft the totals can be significantly less or even zero if no modes are retained.

Resid ual flexibility vectors is one of the options to use to account for the flexibility effects of the reduced out modes ( See NASA- HDBK -7005, Dynamic Environmental Criteria, for

4.3.2.1  [LAR 17] Preliminary  limit load factors  for components  shall  be obtained  from  a mass acceleration  curve ( MAC)  or table  that specifies  load factors  as a function  of component  weight, frequency  range,  structural support  type,  or other  variables . 
[Rationale:  The  development  of a mass acceleration curve is to be  based on previous  experience  with the LV and s pacecraft, and, if possible,  incorporate  results from  previous  transient  and random vibration analyses, as well as any available  flight  data.  The MAC is derived to represent a combined load factor for component low frequency and random vibration loads. ] 
These component load factors may be defined as a function of component weight, frequency range, structural support type, or other variables. The load factors should be based on available flight data, test data, analyses, and experience.  
Load factors  for payload components  are typically  higher  than the payload load  factors. Refer to Appendix B.5 for  guidance. 
For preliminary random load factors (prior to the design becoming more than a concept), methods include ( 1) use MileÕs equation for a single degree -of-freedom system , and (2) use three  times the composite g rms of the specified random vibration environments . See Appendix B.4.3, for additional information.  
4.3.2.2  [LAR 18] The component limit load factors  shall  include  effects  of quasi -steady, transient , and random  loading  and thus represent  the total dynamic load environment  for a flight  event.

The LV organization will develop the CLA forcing functions for all the mission load regimes up to payload separation.

The goal is to provide families of for cing functions that yield load responses that will not be exceeded on 99.87 percent of flights with 50 percent confidence level. In addition, any flight experience for the same/similar configuration has to be enveloped. Acceptable approaches are statistica l computation of results (this includes loads combination equations), or Monte Carlo selection of parameters with the statistical enclosure determined using order statistics. In both approaches, accurate knowledge of statistical variation of parameters is desired.

4.7.1  [LAR 38] To reduce design impacts  associated with  load changes,  uncertainty factors shall  be approved for each loads analysis cycle by the delegated T echnical A uthority  and applied to dynamic loads analysis results . 
[Rationale:  Coupled loads analysis has uncertainty associated with both the LV and spacecraft inputs to the CLA, which are typically accounted for by using uncertainty factors. From the LV perspective, the uncertainty is due primarily to using approximate forcing functions and unverified models in the CLA, especially for vehicles with no flight history.]  
This uncertainty may  be accounted for by incorporating a factor  in the results  of load cycles.  This uncertainty  factor  is used  to account  for immaturity  in models  and design, forcing functions, and for changes  in LV models  and forcing functions . (See supplemental information in section B.6. ) 
Use of an uncertainty  factor  to account  for model  variations  may be avoided by using sensitivity  analysis. Systematic changes  are made  to potentially  uncertain payload properties, and  the resulting loads  are computed. The design load is taken  from  the worst  case analyzed or  from  a statistical combination of all cases. Since  payload loads  are strongly dependent  on the  frequencies  of the payload  modes,  frequency  sensitivity  (or ÒtuningÓ)  analysis  is a natural technique. By  developing design loads  that envelop  a broad  range  of frequency  shifts  (for example,  ±15 percent),  the structural design  is capable  of handling  the load increases  that may occur  as the design  matures. This  type of analysis  has the advantage  of increasing loads  only for those  items  that are sensitive  to frequency  shifts.  
For guidance on spacecraft uncertainty factors, see Appendix B.6.  
4.7.2  [LAR 39] In subsequent  load cycles,  the uncertainty factor  shall  be gradually  reduced  as the structural  design  and load analysis  prediction  mature , requiring  approval from the delegated Technical Authority  for any uncertainty factor reduction. 
See supplemental information in Appendix  B.6. NASA -STD -5002A
CLA g eneral practice calls for a minimum factor of 1.4 to 1.5 for the preliminary design load cycle and 1.2 to 1.25 for the final design load cycle to cover payload uncertainty . The payload uncertainty factor can be reduced to 1.1 for the verification load cycle  after the structure is built  and the model is verified  based on the requirements specified in s ection 4.9. Additional 
factors may be used by the LV  to address uncertainty associated with the maturity of LV models and forcing functions . 
For static loads analysis, factor of safety (FOS) are to be applied to limit loads per NASA -STD-5001.  
For random vibration loads analysis, the delegated Technical Authority should address application of input forcing functions that include uncertainty factors.  
4.7.3  [LAR 40] I f the model  verification  is determined to be inadequate by the delegated Technical Authority , an uncertainty  factor  higher than 1.1 shall  be retained  in the  verification  load analysis cycle.  ",The minimum uncertainty factor for my payload must be:,A) Between 1.35 and 1.5 for a preliminary design.,B) Less than 1.1 for the verification load cycle after the structure is built.,C) Between 1.2 and 1.25 for the final design load cycle. ,C,No,Qualitative,4.7.2
